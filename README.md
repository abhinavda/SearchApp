# Intent:
Amazon search results contain lot of sponsored items. These would repeat even if we get to next few pages, which is unnecessary. 
Feedback on any item is very important. This helps us understand if the product is reliable and is worth the money. Amazon.com doesn't have an option to sort the products by number of reviews.

# Requirements:
1. Python 2.7
2. BeautifulSoup
3. Django
4. HTML/CSS

Python is easy language to learn and understand. There are also number of webscraping libraries (example:- BeautifulSoup) that can be used by python to extract and intrepret the data from webpages.
Django is high level python web framework which is used by developers to provide services.

# Results:
A working webapp is hosted on AWS. It can be found at http://bit.ly/2ksZlYc


# Use cases:
1. It provides only the most reliabe products.
2. Bestbuy and Walmart search can be added to webapp, making it easy to search for all reliable products just from one website.
